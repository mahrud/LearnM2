Proof supports typesetting mathematics with [$$\KaTeX$$](https://katex.org).
You can use `$$ .. $$` to write formulas following $$\LaTeX$$ math syntax:

~~~ markdown
The function $$\nu$$ is written inline, but can also be in a block:

$$ \nu: \mathbb{P}^{1} \to \mathbb{P}^{3} $$
~~~

A comprehensive list of supported functions is available [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

If you are not familiar with writing mathematics in $$\LaTeX$$, I highly recommend reading and bookmarking this [Wikibooks reference](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) and using it to typeset problem sets or exercises to practice.

To learn more about $$\LaTeX$$ itself, [D.R.Wilkins' Primer](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/) is a decent place to start.
