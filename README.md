Proof
=====

Proof is a minimal Jekyll theme for mathematicians based on [Ed](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/), which is in turn based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Ed is focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility, hence it is a perfect ground field for building a theme for collaborating and documenting mathematics.

To learn how to install and begin using Proof, visit Ed's [documentation](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/documentation).
